# COVID-19 Data Scraping and Visualization

This project aims to collect and visualize COVID-19 data for affected, death, recovered, and active cases in different states of India. The data is obtained through web scraping from multiple websites, and Python is used to process the data and create informative visualizations.

## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to scrape data related to COVID-19 cases in India from at least three different websites. The data includes the number of affected cases, deaths, recoveries, and active cases, and each section should mention the source of the data. Finally, the collected data is visualized using Python to provide meaningful insights.

## Approach

The project uses the following tools and libraries:
- Python
- Requests for making HTTP requests to websites
- BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML content
- Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
- Matplotlib for creating visualizations

The code snippets provided demonstrate the web scraping process, where data is extracted from a specified website and transformed into a Pandas DataFrame. The extracted data is then processed, and irrelevant rows and columns are dropped. Finally, the remaining data is used to create visualizations.

## Charts

The visualizations in this project are created using Matplotlib, a popular Python library for data visualization. The specific types of charts used will depend on the nature of the data and the insights you want to convey. Examples of possible charts include bar charts, line charts, and pie charts, depending on the specific requirements.

## How to Run

To run the code and retrieve the COVID-19 data for India, follow these steps:
1. Install the required libraries mentioned in the project description (requests, BeautifulSoup, pandas, matplotlib).
2. Set up the necessary Python environment.
3. Execute the provided code to perform web scraping and data processing.
4. Review the generated DataFrame containing the collected data.
5. Use the available functions from Matplotlib to create custom charts based on the collected data.

Please note that the code may need modifications based on the specific websites from which you want to scrape data.
